This is a project that I started for a Devmountain Coding Basics class. We were tasked with creating a storefront for an e-commerce website.<br>

The storefront had to have these 2 features at the minimum:<br>
1. An "add to cart/wishlist/watchlist" feature<br>
2. An email input that responded to the user clicking on a button<br>
<br>
Havana also has these additional features:<br>
3. Email validation using a regex<br>
4. A search bar that uses the user's input to search through keywords in the horses' card descriptions<br>
<br>
Features in progress:<br>
5. Filters that will use the user's input and show only horses matching the selected filters<br>
6. The watchlist box will show the most recent 2 horses who have been watchlisted<br>
<br>
Future features:<br>
7. Search/filter horses by object keys rather than card description HTML<br>
8. Horses can only be watchlisted once; "add to watchlist" will be removed once clicked on<br>
