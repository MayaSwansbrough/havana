<p>This is a project that I started for a Devmountain Coding Basics class. We were tasked with creating a storefront for an e-commerce website.</p>

The storefront had to have these 2 features at the minimum:
1. An "add to cart/wishlist/watchlist" feature
2. An email input that responded to the user clicking on a button

Havana also has these additional features:
3. Email validation using a regex
4. A search bar that uses the user's input to search through keywords in the horses' card descriptions

Features in progress:
5. Filters that will use the user's input and show only horses matching the selected filters
6. The watchlist box will show the most recent 2 horses who have been watchlisted

Future features:
7. Search/filter horses by object keys rather than card description HTML
8. Horses can only be watchlisted once; "add to watchlist" will be removed once clicked on
